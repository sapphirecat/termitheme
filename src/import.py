# Usage: import.py [-n/--name <profile>] [-b/--base <profile>] <themefile>
# Imports a theme in <themefile> as a new gnome-terminal profile. The theme
# name from the <themefile> can be overridden using the -n option; the theme
# will use settings from gnome-terminal's default theme for non-theme-related
# settings. This, too, can be overridden with the -b option.
